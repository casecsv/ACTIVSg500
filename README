Synthetic South Carolina 500-bus power system model.

This is an entirely synthetic 500 bus case, geographically situated
in the northwestern part of the US state of South Carolina. The case is
designed with a 345 and 138 kV transmission network to serve
a load that roughly mimics the actual population of its geographic
footprint. The synthetic transmission system was designed by
algorithms described in [1] to be statistically similar to actual
transmission system models but without modeling any actual lines.

This is a synthetic power system model that does not represent the
actual grid. It was developed as part of the US ARPA-E GRID DATA
research project and contains no CEII.
